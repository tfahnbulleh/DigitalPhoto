Obtain a collection of n small images in PNG or JPG format, where n is an
integer between 3 and 10. Index the images with numbers 1,. . . n. Write a
program that displays the images in order of increasing index, holding each
image on the screen for two seconds before moving on to the next. When it
gets to the highest index, the program cycles and begins again at 1. Write
your program in such a way that it will work for different values of n by
changing a single line in your code.
